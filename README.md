# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge I did!.

I used vanilla css, and html for this.

The size might be different cause I just don't know how to deal with it. (I'm still a beginner)

Anyways thank you for checking out my attempt!
